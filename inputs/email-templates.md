## Initial Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Problem-Agitate-Solve

Best for: Clear pain point, strong solution fit

```
Subject: {Quick question|Thoughts?|Idea for {{company}}}

{{sl_time_of_day}} {{firstName}},

{{customField3}}

[Pain point statement - 1 sentence about their challenge]

[Solution hint - how you help, with proof point]

{Worth a quick chat?|Open to learning more?|Interested?}

{{sender-firstname}}
```

**Example filled in:**

```
Subject: Quick question about {{company}}'s outbound

Good morning {{firstName}},

Saw {{company}} is hiring 3 SDRs — exciting growth phase.

Most sales leaders I talk to at this stage hit a wall: 
scaling outreach without quality dropping off a cliff.

We helped TechCorp solve this and book 3x more meetings 
with half the manual effort.

Worth a quick chat?

Alex
```

### Template 2: Trigger Event

Best for: Timely outreach based on news/events

```
Subject: {Congrats on|Re:|Saw} {{customField7}}

{Hi|Hey} {{firstName}},

{{customField7}} — [brief congratulations or acknowledgment].

[Transition to relevance - why this matters for them]

[Your value prop tied to the trigger]

{Curious if this is on your radar?|Worth exploring?}

{{sender-firstname}}
```

**Example filled in:**

```
Subject: Congrats on the Series B

Hey {{firstName}},

Series B — huge milestone for {{company}}. Congrats!

Most companies at this stage are scaling their go-to-market 
fast, which usually means outbound gets messier before it 
gets better.

We've helped 50+ post-Series B companies systematize their 
outreach without losing the personal touch.

Curious if this is on your radar?

Alex

### Template 3: Mutual Connection / Social Proof

Best for: Referrals, warm introductions, peer references

```
Subject: {[Name] suggested I reach out|Fellow [group] member}

{{sl_time_of_day}} {{firstName}},

[Connection reference - how you're connected or similar]

[Brief context on why you're reaching out]

[Value prop relevant to their situation]

{Would it make sense to connect?|Open to a quick chat?}

{{sender-firstname}}
```

---

### Template 4: Value-First / Resource Share

Best for: Top-of-funnel, building relationship first

```
Subject: {[Resource] for {{company}}|Thought you'd find this useful}

{Hi|Hey} {{firstName}},

[Context - why you thought of them]

[Resource or insight you're sharing]

[Brief tie to how you can help further]

{Let me know if it's useful.|Happy to share more if helpful.}

{{sender-firstname}}
```

---

### Template 5: Direct Ask

Best for: High-intent situations, clear fit

```
Subject: {15 min this week?|Quick call about [topic]?}

{{sl_time_of_day}} {{firstName}},

[One sentence on why you're reaching out]

[One sentence on what you do / value prop]

[Social proof - one line]

{Do you have 15 minutes this week?|Open to a quick call?}

{{sender-firstname}}
```

## Follow-Up Templates

### Follow-Up 1: Soft Bump (Day 3)

```
Subject: Re: [Original subject]

{Hi|Hey} {{firstName}},

Wanted to float this back up.

[One new piece of value or insight - different from Email 1]

{Still happy to chat if it makes sense.|Let me know if worth exploring.}

{{sender-firstname}}
```

**Example:**

```
Subject: Re: Quick question about {{company}}'s outbound

Hey {{firstName}},

Wanted to float this back up.

One thing I forgot to mention — we just published a guide on 
scaling SDR teams without quality dropping. Happy to share if useful.

Still open to a quick chat if timing works.

Alex
```

---

### Follow-Up 2: New Angle (Day 7-8)

```
Subject: {Idea for {{company}}|Different thought}

{Hi|Hey} {{firstName}},

[New angle - different hook than Email 1]

[Different value prop or use case]

[Social proof specific to this angle]

{Worth a look?|Interested in learning more?}

{{sender-firstname}}
```

---

### Follow-Up 3: Breakup Email (Day 14-15)

```
Subject: {Should I close your file?|Closing the loop}

{Hi|Hey} {{firstName}},

I haven't heard back, so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

{I'll close out your file for now|Going to assume this isn't a priority}, 
but feel free to reach out if [pain point] becomes a focus.

{Wishing you and the {{company}} team continued success.|All the best.}

{{sender-firstname}}
```

## Reply Handling Templates

### Positive Reply Response

```
Subject: Re: [Thread]

{{firstName}}, great to hear from you!

Totally understand, {{firstName}}. Appreciate you letting me know.

If anything changes down the road, feel free to reach out.

Best of luck with everything at {{company}}.

Happy to share more, {{firstName}}.

[Brief additional context - 2-3 sentences max]

how this could work for {{company}}?
