## Spintax for Variation

Spintax creates email variations to improve deliverability and test messaging.

### Syntax

```
{option1|option2|option3}
```

### Examples

**Greetings:**

```
{Hi|Hey|Hello} {{firstName}},
```

**Opening lines:**

```
{Hope your week is going well|Hope you're having a great {{sl_day_of_week}}|Quick note for you}
```

**CTAs:**

```
{Worth a quick chat?|Open to connecting?|Interested in learning more?}
```

**Full example:**

```
{Hi|Hey|Hello} {{firstName}},

{Saw|Noticed|Came across} {{company}}'s {recent announcement|latest news|growth} 
and {wanted to reach out|thought I'd connect|had a quick thought}.

{Worth a chat|Open to a quick call|Interested in connecting}?

{{sender-firstname}}
```

### Spintax Best Practices

- Keep variations natural (don't force awkward phrasing)
- Test 3-5 variants per element
- Don't over-spin (too many variations = inconsistent voice)
- Use for greetings, transitions, and CTAs primarily

## AI Prompt Engineering for Cold Email

### Input Data Structure

When prompting AI to generate email content, provide structured data:

```
PROSPECT DATA:
- Name: {{firstName}} {{lastName}}
- Title: {{jobTitle}}
- Company: {{company}}
- Industry: {{industry}}

- Sender Name: {{sender-firstname}}
```

### Prompt Structure

Effective AI prompts for cold email follow this structure:

1. **Role**: Define what the AI should act as
2. **Context**: Provide background information
3. **Task**: Specify what to generate
4. **Constraints**: Set boundaries (length, tone, format)
5. **Examples**: Show good/bad examples
6. **Output Format**: Define expected structure

### Example Prompt Template

```
ROLE:
You are an expert B2B cold email copywriter specializing in 
[industry] outreach.

CONTEXT:
- Sender company: [Company] helps [target audience] achieve [outcome]

2. Shows genuine research (not generic flattery)
3. Naturally transitions to a business context

CONSTRAINTS:

## Personalization Tiers

### Tier 1: Basic (Automated)

**Data used**: Name, Company, Title

**Example:**

```
Hi {{firstName}},

As {{jobTitle}} at {{company}}, you're likely dealing with [common challenge].
```

**Effort**: Low
**Impact**: Moderate

### Tier 2: Enhanced (Semi-Automated)

**Data used**: Basic + Industry, Company Size, Tech Stack

**Example:**

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Noticed {{company}} is in the [industry] space with [tech stack detail]. 
Most [industry] companies at your stage struggle with [specific challenge].
```

**Effort**: Medium
**Impact**: High

### Tier 3: Deep (AI-Assisted)

**Data used**: All above + Recent Activity, News, LinkedIn Posts

**Example:**

```
Hi {{firstName}},

{{customField1_icebreaker}}

Given {{company}}'s recent [trigger event], I imagine [specific challenge] 
is top of mind.
```

**Effort**: Medium-High
**Impact**: Very High

## Workflow: AI-Generated Personalization at Scale

### Step 1: Prepare Lead List

Export leads with these columns:

| Column | Maps To |
|--------|---------|
| first_name | `{{firstName}}` |
| last_name | `{{lastName}}` |
| email | Email field |
| company | `{{company}}` |
| job_title | `{{customField1}}` or reference |
| linkedin_url | For research |
| company_news | `{{customField2}}` |

### Step 2: Enrich with Research

For each lead, gather:

- Recent LinkedIn activity
- Company news (last 90 days)
- Job postings (hiring signals)
- Tech stack
- Funding/growth signals

### Step 3: Generate AI Content

Use prompts from `/prompts/` to generate:

- Icebreaker (→ `{{customField1}}`)
- Pain point reference (→ `{{customField2}}`)
- Relevant social proof (→ `{{customField3}}`)

### Step 4: Import to Smartlead

Map enriched data to Smartlead custom fields and launch campaign.

## Quality Control Checklist

Before sending AI-generated emails:

- [ ] Icebreakers reference real, verifiable information?
- [ ] No hallucinated facts or fake news references?
- [ ] Tone consistent across all emails?
- [ ] Personalization feels natural, not forced?
- [ ] Custom fields populated for all leads?
- [ ] Spintax variations all sound natural?
- [ ] Tested with 10-20 manual reviews?

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Over-personalization (creepy) | Stick to professional/public information |
| Generic AI output | Provide more specific context in prompts |
| Hallucinated facts | Always verify AI-generated claims |
| Inconsistent tone | Use examples in prompts |
| Missing data handling | Set fallback text for empty fields |

### Fallback Example

```
{{{customField1}}|Noticed {{company}} has been growing fast lately}
```

If `customField1` is empty, the second option is used.
