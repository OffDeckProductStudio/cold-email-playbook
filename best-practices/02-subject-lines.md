# Subject Line Best Practices

Your subject line determines whether your email gets opened. Master this first.

---

## Key Principles

### Length

- **Optimal**: 30-60 characters
- **Mobile-friendly**: Under 40 characters (most opens are mobile)
- Shorter = higher open rates in most cases

### Tone

- Conversational, not salesy
- Lowercase often outperforms Title Case
- Questions work well for curiosity

### Personalization

- Including `{{firstName}}` or `{{company}}` increases opens by 26%
- Reference specific details when possible
- Don't over-personalize (feels creepy)

## High-Performing Subject Line Formulas

### 1. The Question

```
Quick question about {{company}}
Question for you, {{firstName}}
Thoughts on [topic]?
```

**Why it works**: Creates curiosity, implies brevity

### 2. The Mutual Connection

```
[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out
Fellow [group/industry] member
```

**Why it works**: Social proof and relevance

### 3. The Trigger Event

```
Congrats on the [funding/launch/hire]
Saw your post about [topic]
Re: {{company}}'s expansion
```

**Why it works**: Timely and relevant

### 4. The Pattern Interrupt

```
{{firstName}}, random question
This might be off base
Not sure if this is relevant
```

**Why it works**: Breaks expectations, feels human

### 5. The Direct Approach

```
[Specific result] for {{company}}
Idea for [their goal]
15 min this week?
```

**Why it works**: Clear and respectful of time

### 6. The Curiosity Gap

```
Noticed something about {{company}}
Quick thought
{{firstName}} - idea
```

**Why it works**: Incomplete information drives opens

## What to Avoid

### Spam Triggers

- ALL CAPS
- Excessive punctuation (!!!)
- Words: "Free", "Guarantee", "Act now", "Limited time"
- Dollar amounts or percentages
- "RE:" or "FWD:" when it's not a reply

### Overpromising

- "This will change everything"
- "You won't believe..."
- "The secret to..."

### Generic

- "Introduction"
- "Following up"
- "Checking in"
- "Hope you're well"

## A/B Testing Strategy

### In Smartlead

Use spintax to test variations:

```
{Quick question|Thoughts?|Idea for {{company}}}
```

### What to Test

1. **Personalization**: Name vs. no name
2. **Length**: Short (3-5 words) vs. medium (6-10 words)
3. **Format**: Question vs. statement
4. **Tone**: Formal vs. casual
5. **Specificity**: Vague vs. detailed

### Sample Size

- Minimum 100 sends per variant
- Run for at least 48 hours
- Track opens AND replies (opens alone can mislead)

## Subject Line Templates by Goal

### Book a Meeting

```
15 min this week, {{firstName}}?
Quick call about [topic]?
Time for a chat?
```

### Start a Conversation

```
Thoughts on [topic]?
Quick question about [their initiative]
{{firstName}} - curious about something
```

### Share Value/Content

```
[Resource] for {{company}}
Thought you'd find this useful
Research on [topic] you might like
```

### Follow-Up

```
Re: [original subject]
Following up on my note
Did this get buried?
Any thoughts?
```

## Smartlead Variables for Subject Lines

{{lastName}} - Prospect's last name  
{{company}} - Company name
{{sl_day_of_week}} - Current day
{{customField1-20}} - Custom prospect data
```
