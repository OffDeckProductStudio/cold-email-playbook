# Cold Email Fundamentals

Core principles for writing cold emails that get responses.

---

## The Golden Rules

### 1. Keep It Short

- **Optimal length**: 50-125 words (6-8 sentences)
- Shorter emails respect the recipient's time
- Every sentence must earn its place

### 2. Plain Text Only

- No HTML formatting, images, or fancy templates
- Plain text feels personal, not promotional
- Better deliverability and inbox placement

### 3. One Clear CTA

- Single call-to-action per email
- Make it easy to say yes
- Low-friction asks work best (reply, not "book a 30-min call")

### 4. Value First, Pitch Second

- Lead with insight or relevance to them
- Show you understand their world
- Your product is the solution, not the subject

### 5. Write Like a Human

- Conversational tone, not corporate speak
- First-person singular ("I" not "we")
- Read it aloud—if it sounds robotic, rewrite it

## What NOT to Do

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Start with "My name is..." | They can see your name in the signature |
| Lead with your company's story | They don't care yet |
| Use "just following up" | Adds no value |
| Include multiple links | Triggers spam filters |
| Attach files | Never on first touch |
| Use ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation | Looks spammy |
| Write paragraphs | Use short sentences and line breaks |

## The Psychology of Cold Email

### Why People Reply

1. **Relevance** - "This person understands my situation"
2. **Curiosity** - "I want to know more"
3. **Social proof** - "Others like me have benefited"
4. **Timing** - "I was just thinking about this"
5. **Ease** - "Replying takes 10 seconds"

### Why People Ignore

1. **Generic** - "This is a mass email"
2. **Selfish** - "They only care about selling"
3. **Long** - "I don't have time for this"
4. **Confusing** - "What do they even want?"
5. **Pushy** - "They're trying too hard"

## The 3-Second Test

Your email must pass these checks in 3 seconds:

- [ ] Is it obvious why you're reaching out to THEM specifically?
- [ ] Is the value proposition clear?
- [ ] Is the ask simple and low-friction?
- [ ] Would YOU reply to this email?

## Framework: AIDA for Cold Email

| Stage | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **A**ttention | Hook with relevance | "Saw your post on scaling engineering teams..." |
| **I**nterest | Agitate the pain | "Most CTOs struggle with..." |
| **D**esire | Present the solution | "We've helped companies like X achieve Y..." |
| **A**ction | Clear next step | "Worth a quick chat?" |

## Smartlead Tip

Use Smartlead's `{{sl_time_of_day}}` variable to make your greeting dynamic:

```
{{sl_time_of_day}} {{firstName}},
```

This automatically becomes "Good morning", "Good afternoon", or "Good evening" based on send time.
