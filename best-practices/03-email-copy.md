A proven framework adapted for cold email:

| Element | Purpose | Length |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **P**ersonalization | Show you know them | 1-2 sentences |
| **A**gitate | Highlight their pain | 1-2 sentences |
| **S**olution | Hint at how you help | 1-2 sentences |
| **T**estimony | Social proof (optional) | 1 sentence |
| **O**ffer | What you're proposing | 1 sentence |
| **R**esponse | Clear CTA | 1 sentence |

**Total**: 50-125 words

## Opening Lines

The first line must grab attention. It appears in preview text alongside the subject line.

### What Works

**Reference their work:**

```
Saw your post on [topic] — really resonated with me.
Your recent podcast on [topic] was spot-on.
Loved what you shared about [specific insight].
```

**Reference a trigger event:**

```
Congrats on the Series A — exciting times ahead.
Noticed {{company}} just expanded to [market].
Saw you're hiring for [role] — sounds like you're scaling fast.
```

**Reference mutual ground:**

```
[Name] mentioned you're the go-to person for [topic].
We both spoke at [event] last year.
Fellow [YC company / industry peer / alumni].
```

**Reference their pain directly:**

```
Guessing [common problem] is on your radar right now.
Most [their role] I talk to are wrestling with [challenge].
```

### What to Avoid

- "My name is..." (they can see your name)
- "I hope this email finds you well" (filler)
- "I wanted to reach out because..." (weak)
- "I know you're busy, but..." (apologetic)

## The Body: Pain → Solution

### Agitating the Pain

Demonstrate you understand their world:

```
Scaling a sales team is brutal — reps ramping slowly, 
inconsistent messaging, deals slipping through the cracks.
```

```
Most marketing leaders I talk to are drowning in data 
but starving for insights that actually drive decisions.
```

**Tips:**

- Be specific, not generic
- Use their language (from job posts, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Don't assume—frame as observation

### Presenting the Solution

Hint at value without feature-dumping:

```
We help companies like [similar company] cut ramp time in half 
by giving reps real-time coaching during calls.
```

```
Our platform helped [customer] increase qualified pipeline 
by 40% in 90 days.
```

**Tips:**

- Lead with outcomes, not features
- Use numbers when possible
- Reference similar companies (social proof)

---

## Social Proof

One line of credibility goes a long way:

```
We work with [recognizable company names].
```

```
[Specific customer] saw [specific result] in [timeframe].
```

```
[Number] of [their peer companies] use us for [use case].
```

**Placement:** After solution, before CTA

---

## The CTA (Call to Action)

### Principles

- **Single ask**: One CTA only
- **Low friction**: Easy to say yes
- **Clear next step**: No ambiguity

### CTA Spectrum (Low → High Friction)

| CTA | Friction Level |
|-----|----------------|
| "Worth exploring?" | Very Low |
| "Interested in learning more?" | Low |
| "Open to a quick chat?" | Medium |
| "Do you have 15 minutes this week?" | Medium-High |
| "Can we schedule a 30-minute demo?" | High |

### Effective CTA Examples

```
Worth a quick chat to see if this fits?
```

```
Would it make sense to connect for 15 minutes?
```

```
Open to hearing how we did this for [similar company]?
```

```
If this resonates, happy to share more. If not, no worries.
```

### CTAs to Avoid

- "Let me know when you're free" (puts burden on them)
- "Click here to schedule" (too salesy for cold)
- Multiple options (pick one)

---

## Tone and Voice

### Do

- Write in first person ("I" not "We")
- Use contractions ("I'm", "you're", "we've")
- Keep sentences short (under 20 words)
- Use line breaks liberally
- Sound like you're talking to a colleague

### Don't

- Use jargon or buzzwords
- Be overly formal
- Use passive voice
- Write walls of text
- Sound desperate or pushy

### Example: Before and After

**Before (Bad):**

```
Our company provides innovative solutions that leverage 
cutting-edge technology to optimize business processes 
and drive digital transformation for enterprise clients 
seeking to enhance operational efficiency.
```

**After (Good):**

```
We help companies like yours cut reporting time in half.

Acme Corp went from 10 hours/week to 4 using our tool.

Worth a quick chat to see if we can do the same for you?
```

## Formatting Rules

### Line Breaks

- 1-2 sentences per paragraph max
- White space is your friend
- Makes mobile reading easier

### Signature

Keep it minimal:

```
{{sender-firstname}}
{{sender-title}}, {{sender-company}}
```

Avoid:

- Long email signatures
- Images/logos
- Multiple links
- Quotes or taglines

## Complete Email Example

```
Subject: Quick question about {{company}}'s outbound

{{sl_time_of_day}} {{firstName}},

Saw {{company}} is hiring 3 SDRs — sounds like you're 
scaling outbound fast.

Most sales leaders I talk to hit a wall around this stage: 
reps ramping slowly, inconsistent messaging, deals falling 
through the cracks.

We helped [Similar Company] cut ramp time by 50% and 
increase meetings booked per rep by 35%.

Worth a quick chat to see if we could help {{company}} 
hit those hiring goals faster?

{{sender-firstname}}
```

**Word count:** 78 words

## Smartlead Variables Reference

Use these in your copy:

```
{{firstName}}, {{lastName}}, {{company}}
{{sl_time_of_day}} - "Good morning/afternoon/evening"
{{sl_day_of_week}} - "Monday", "Tuesday", etc.
{{sl_date "2 days from now" "MMMM Do"}} - "December 11th"
{{customField1}} through {{customField20}}
```

### Spintax for Variation

```
{Hi|Hey|Hello} {{firstName}},

{Saw your recent post|Noticed {{company}}'s announcement} 
about {scaling|growth|expansion}.

{Worth a chat|Open to connecting|Interested in learning more}?
```
